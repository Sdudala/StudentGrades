# StudentGrades
StudentGrades using Windows Forms
Displays Grades related to five students.
Each student has three assignments/subjects and all the individual grades pertaining to a student can be displayed.
StudentList is implemented using a singleton pattern so as to ensure only one instance of StudentList and easy access to StudentList in case of future development.
Iterating through the StudentList is implemented through iterator design pattern.

Student information is hardcoded in this assignment, as procuring student information through UI is not the main intention of this assignment. The student grades are generated using pseudo random number generator and as such, the veracity of the cumulative grade logic for a student can be verified.
